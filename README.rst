*PyETo* is a Python library for calculating reference crop evapotranspiration
(ET\ :sub:`o`\ ), sometimes referred to as potential evapotranspiration (PET).
The library provides numerous functions for estimating missing meteorological
data.

Three methods for estimating ET\ :sub:`o`\ /PET are implemented:

* FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (Allen et al, 1998)
* Hargreaves (Hargreaves and Samani, 1982; 1985)
* Thornthwaite (Thornthwaite, 1948)
